## Overview

### Specs

The portrait of the programmer as a young artist continues, using random number generation, color, and velocity applied to circles in this little motion poem.  As usual, we're going to be drawing to an HTML5 Canvas element using the drawing API of the CreateJS module, EaselJS, and our helper library, draw, that simplifies the drawing process somewhat.

### Take Away

Using the draw line API to create a cool randomized piece of art.

Some concepts you'll learn are:


* Drawing with CreateJS and our draw utility.
* Leveraging the power of built-in and 3rd party API (DRY), like Math and opspark-draw.
* Variable declaration and initialization.
* Function invocation and passing arguments to functions.
* The for loop.
* Conditional statements - making decisions in code.
* Recognizing code blocks.
* Calculating coordinates in a cartesian system.
* Calculating boundaries.
* Animating.
* Pair programming.

### Entering Code

As we work through the app, you'll find `// TODO //` notes in our `app.js` file, and _under_ these `TODO` lines is where you'll enter the code we need to type.  It's important you enter the code you need to type for the step under these `TODO` place markers, because code is executed in a particular order.

So, to complete a lesson step, _find_ the `TODO` place marker in the appropriate JavaScript file:

**EXAMPLE**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OperationSpark/using-c9/master/img/find-todo.png">

...then put your cursor on the line below the `TODO`, and enter the code from the current lesson step:

**EXAMPLE**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OperationSpark/using-c9/master/img/todo-done.png">

Sweet!

### Type of App : Web

Note that **this app will run _in a web browser_**, preferably Chrome.

## Lesson Steps

All of our coding will happen in the and write your code in the `<script id="motion-poem">` tag located at the bottom of the `index.html` file.

So, open the file at:

### Initializing Our App

Starting up an application often takes a few steps of:

* Importing some libraries of code.
* Loading some external data.
* Declaring and initializing some variables for use in our app.

We've setup the app a little bit already, importing some libraries and initializing the basic plumbing in the background, and we won't be loading any external data in our app, so let's move on to declaring, initializing and using our variables.

Our motion poem will contain 100 randomly drawn circles, arranged randomly within the area of our canvas.  The big takeaway in this project is **DRY**: Don't repeat yourself!

We want to draw 100 circles, but we don't want to write the code to do so 100 times.  That would be a silly waste of time and effort, making the code very difficult to maintain.

#### Loops To The Rescue

Every programming language comes with features built-in to help you implement repetative processes, like looping over a list of data, or drawing a circle 100 times.  If we want to do anything more than once, we can use a _loop_, and is most often best practice to do so. 

Loops are a great tool to repeat a `{ code block }` a specific number of times and JavaScript comes with a number of built in loops, like `for`, `for-in`, and `while`. Additionally, many 3rd party libraries, like <a href="https://lodash.com/">_lodash_</a>, have implementations of other types of loops. We're going to use the `while` and `for` loops to accomplish our tasks for this project. 

### While Loops
Let's start with a `while` loop. To get a while loop to run 100 times we may write something like this:

````javascript
var count = 0;
while(count < 100) {
    // code you want repeated
    count++;
}
````

A `while` loop runs as long as a **condition** is `true`, stopping once the condition becomes `false`. In the example above, 
the loop runs while `count < 100`. This loops make use of a **counter variable** which keeps track of the number of loops that have been completed. When using a counter variable we must first *instantiate* it before the loop: `var count = 0;` and then *update* it within the loop: `count++;`. On each repitition of the loop, the counter variable will increment (increase by 1) until it reaches 100 at which point the condition will evaluate to `false` and the loop will stop!

Failing to update a counter variable within a loop results in an **infinite loop** - a loop whose condition is forever `true` and therefore never stops. Creating an infinite loop consumes all available memory as the program runs and ultimately will crash the program. **This is bad**. 

### For Loops
Another kind of loop we will use is the `for` loop. The for loops takes the counting pattern used in the previous example and condenses it into one line. To create a for loop that runs 100 times we may write something like this:

````javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
````

After the keyword `for` are parentheses where you setup your for loop. Here is where you define how the loops starts, when it ends, and how you want to move on from one loop to the next. There are three parts to it:

* **initialization** : `var i = 0;`
	* a variable `i` is initialized to act as a counter to keep track of how many times we have run our loop. We start at 0.
* **stop condition** : `i < 100;`
	* This statement is the condition against which we check on each loop. If `i` is less than 100, the code block for the loop will execute.
* **post condition** : `i++;`
	* This statement _increments_ (adds 1 to) the `i` variable and is executed after each run of the loop.
	* NOTE: `i++;` is shorthand for `i = i + 1;`, and you'll see the `++` or `--` operators used often in code to accomplish this type of pattern.

Finally, we have our code block within the braces `{ }`.

When all of these are put together our for loop will execute the code block as long as the `i` variable is less than 100. The `i` variable starts at 0 and, because we increment it after each loop, will increase until the stop condition is no longer true - at which point the loop will stop. 

So then, looking at the above snippet of code, what would be the result of running that code? How is the for loop similar and/or different from a while loop?

### Iterating over an Array

For-loops also provide a convenient way to access elements of an Array one at a time. Arrays are *zero-indexed* lists of data. Basically, an Array acts as a container, into which we can throw objects, like strings, numbers, or circles. We call the things we throw into Arrays, _items_ or _elements_, as in, the _elements_ of our Array. Arrays are contained within square brackets `[ ]` and are stored in variables.

````javascript
var friends = ['John', 'Max', 'George', 'Ben', 'Steve', 'Brian'];
````

To retrieve an individual _element_ from an Array, we can use *Bracket Notation*, which uses the name of the Array, followed by square brackets that enclose a number representing the position of the element.

So, we can access the elements of the `friends` Array like so:

````javascript
var name = friends[1];
console.log(name); // prints Max
````

So, above, we used *Bracket Notation* to access the second element of the `friends` Array, `friends[1]`, which equates to `Max` and then log that value to the console. Because Arrays are zero-indexed, the first element is at index 0, the second element is at index 1, and so on.

When we want to access _every_ value within an array, this is called *iterating*. Iterating is the process of accessing each value of an Array using a for loop. This works by using the counter variable of a for loop (often named `i` - short for index) as a placeholder for the numbered index we want to access like so: 

````javascript
for (var i = 0; i < friends.length; i++) {
    var name = friends[i]. 
    console.log(name); // prints a different friend's name on each loop
}
````

As the value of `i` changes within the loop, so too will the value of `name` as it gets assigned to a new element within the Array `friends`. Notice that the stop condition of our loop has changed as well. We want to access every value of our array whose indexes range from `0` to `friends.length - 1`. Study the way that the for loop above has been set up to understand how we accomplish this.

***

### TODOs

#### TODO 1 : Declare Our Variables

The goal of this project is to create 100 animated circles. Before we get ahead of ourselves, let's create one circle. Declare a variable to hold that circle (we will deal with initializing it later). Also we want to create an empty array to hold our circles, more on that later:

Find **TODO 1** and declare our variables like so:

````javascript
// other code...

// TODO 1: Declare our variables //
var circle;
var circles = [];

// other code...
````

#### TODO 2 : Create a function to draw a circle

We will want to draw many circles in this project so putting the code to draw one circle inside a **function** will make the code much more re-usable! We've created the a variable for you called `drawCircle` to hold our function. Modify the code under **TODO: 2** and assign `drawCircle` to a function with the following code block:

````javascript
var drawCircle = function() {
    // TODO 2: Draw a circle //
    circle = draw.randomCircleInArea(canvas, true, true, '#999', 2);
    physikz.addRandomVelocity(circle, canvas);
    view.addChild(circle);
    circles.push(circle);
    // other code...
}
````

##### What does this function actually do?

`draw` is a library of functions that allow us to draw various shapes on our `canvas`. This method, `draw.randomCircleInArea` will draw a circle of random size, color, and location within the screen along with a few other settings. Check out the API:

    randomCircleInArea(area, randomizeAlpha, addCross, borderColor, borderThickness, randomRadialProps)
    
We temporarily store the output of the function in `circle`. We then use the `physikz` library, a library of functions that provide motion to canvas drawings, to add a random velocity and direction to our circle.

To get the circle to appear on the screen we add the circle as a *child* of `view` (Think of the parent <-> child relationship of HTML elements!).

Lastly we save each new circle in an array using the `.push()` method. Doing so keeps all circles that we make together in one location which will be very useful very soon!

#### TODO 3 : Draw 3 circles!

Now, Call this function 5 times to see 5 circles appear on the screen. You can call the function using the following syntax:

```javascript
functionName(argument1, argument2, ...);
```

Pretty, right? But we want to draw 100 circles! If we were to call this function 100 times in our code, it would violate the **DRY Rule: D**ont **R**epeat **Y**ourself. Keep this in mind as we move on. We'll find a better way to do this!

#### TODO 4 : Move your Circles!

Awesome, let's do some fun stuff with our circles now.  Remember that our `update()` method is called 60 times per second, so it gives us the perfect place to update properties of our display objects in order to create the illusion of motion, otherwise known as, _animation_! To get our circles to move we will use the `physikz.updatePosition()` method which accepts a circle as an argument. 

Our circles are all stored in the `circles` **Array**. Arrays are _zero-indexed_ lists of objects.  Basically, an Array acts as a container, into which we can throw objects, like strings, numbers, or circles. We call the things we throw into Arrays, _items_ or _elements_, as in, the _elements_ of our Array.

To retrieve an individual _element_ from an Array, we can use _Array syntax_, which uses the name of the Array, followed by square brackets that enclose a number representing the position of the element.

So, if we had an Array like this:

````javascript
var friends = ['John', 'Max', 'George', 'Ben', 'Steve', 'Brian'];
````

Then we can access the elements of the `friends` Array like so:

````javascript
var name = friends[1];
console.log(name); // prints Max
````

So, above, we used _Bracket Notation_ to access the second element of the `friends` Array, `friends[1]`, which equates to `Max`.  Because Arrays are _zero-indexed_, the first element is at index 0, the second element is at index 1, and so on.

Now, within in the `update` function, use Bracket Notation to pull out the five circles from the `circles` array and pass them to the `physikz.updatePosition()` function. Below is an example of passing the first circle in the array to the function:

````javascript
function update() {
    // TODO 4 : Update the circle's position //
    physikz.updatePosition(circles[0]);
    // code to call the function on the other 4 circles...
}
````

#### Cartesian Coordinates

Our next challenge is to keep the circles in our screen. To do so we must understand the Cartesian Coordinates of a computer screen. 

A computer screen is nothing more than a graph with an *x-axis* and a *y-axis* measured in units of *pixels*. A computer screen may be composed of millions of pixels so understanding this coordinate system is vital to accurately place animations on the screen. 

The *origin*, where the x-axis and y-axis intersect at 0, is always located in the top left corner of the browser window. As you move accross the screen from left to right, x values of pixels increase. As you move down the screen from top to bottom, the y values of pixels increases. 

<img src="img/screenBounds.png" height="300px">

Imagine you had two images: Image-A is located at x/y position (100, 500) and Image-B is located at x/y position (300, 200). Where are they positioned relative to each other? Image-A has a smaller x-value so it would be to the left of Image-B. However, it has the larger y-value, therefore it will be below Image-B. 

Good! Now that we understand how the coordinates of the screen work we have to understand one more concept: how big the window is! Since the size of a browser window can be resized this value will never be the same. Therefore, we must use a *variable*! In our program we have done this for you by providing the values: 
 
    canvas.width    // The the width of our canvas.
    canvas.height   // The height of our canvas.

The `canvas` is a data type known as an Object (we'll learn more about this later) which represents the blank screen and allows us to add drawings to it. The canvas has 2 very important *properties* `.width` and `.height` that provide us with size of the window. Using this data, along with the knowing where our origin is, we can easily tell whether or not an image is in view by checking the image's x/y position to see if it contained within the box (0, 0) -> (canvas.width, canvas.height). 

#### TODO 5 : Keep your circles in the screen

We have created a function for you called `checkCircleBounds`. The function accepts a circle as an argument and uses a series of conditional statements to determine if the circle is within the bounds of the `canvas` (the variable holding the dimensions of our screen).

So, if a circle leaves the `canvas` along the _bottom_ border, we need to place the circle fully off the `canvas` at the top border.

Write a test for each border of the canvas that checks if the circle has fully exited the canvas by _that_ border. Using a chain of `if`, `else-if` statements, you'll need one test for each border, right-side, left-side, top, and bottom. If a circle leaves the canvas by one of its borders, you need to place the circle fully off the canvas at the opposite border.  Dig?

The best way to start this is to hack away, testing one border at a time!

To do this, you'll have to lean on what you know:

    canvas.width    // The the width of our canvas.
    canvas.height   // The height of our canvas.
    circle.x        // The circle's position along the x-axis, good for testing the right and left side borders.
    circle.y        // The circle's position along the y-axis, good for testing the top and bottom borders.
    circle.radius   // Each circle is of a different size, so the radius will provide this information to you. ALSO, the circle is centered around its own x and y position, so we can find where its outer edges are located within the canvas by adding or subtracting its radius from its own x or y value.  But you'll see this as you hack away to acheive the expected results.

We've _stubbed_ a chain of `if`, `else-if` statements for you, all you need to do is replace the comments between the `()` parentheses with your check for that particular border and then determine where to place the circle if that particular condition is met. 

````javascript
function checkCircleBounds(circle) {
    // TODO 5 : YOUR CODE STARTS HERE //////////////////////
    if ( circle.x > canvas.width + circle.radius ) {
        circle.x = 0 - circle.radius;
    } else if ( / * test for left-side * / ) {
        // your code to place circle exactly off the stage at the right-side //
    } if ( / * test for top * / ) {
        // code to place circle exactly off the stage at the bottom //
    } else if ( / * test for bottom * / ) {
        // your code to place circle exactly off the stage at the top //
    }
    // YOUR TODO 5 CODE ENDS HERE //////////////////////////
}
````

#### TODO 6 : Call checkCircleBounds on each of your circles

Great! Now that we have a function which will keep a circle within the screen, let's use it to continuously check our 5 circles. Within the `update` function call the `checkCircleBounds` function, passing in each of the 5 circles to the function.

#### Take a Break!

Congrats! You have made a beautiful program that creates 5 circles, animates them, and keeps them within the screen. Take a 10 minute break from coding and reflect on the code that you have just written. Do you understand what each component does? 

When writing large programs it is a good practice to start small and work your way up to the full program. So far we have been able to create 5 circles, move them, and keep them in our screen's view. But what if we wanted our program to run with 100 circles? 

#### TODO 7 : Draw 100 circles

A loop should do the job! Here is the basic outline of a while loop and a for loop that each run 10 times:

````javascript
var counter = 0; 
while (counter < 10) {
    // do something
    counter++
}

for (var counter = 0; counter < 10; counter++) {
    // do something
}
````

Below **TODO 3** delete your calls to the `drawCircle` function and replace them with a loop that will loop **100** times and call the `drawCircle` function each time. Feel free to choose whichever loop you want!

#### TODO 8 : Iterate over the array

Now that we have 100 circles, we need a way to move all 100 circles and keep all 100 circles within the screen without calling on each circle individually. **Iterating** is the way to go!

Iteration is the process of accessing every element in an array and performing some action with that element. In our case, we want to access every `circle` from our `circles` array and apply the `physikz.updatePosition(circle)` function on each circle. Since this is a repetitive action, a loop is involved!

Imagine we had an array called `friends` and we wanted to print out each name listed in the Array. We might do something like this:

```javascript
var friends = ['John', 'Max', 'George', 'Ben', 'Steve', 'Brian'];
var friend;
// for loop version
for (var i = 0; i < friends.length; i++) {
    friend = friends[i];
    console.log(friend);
}

// while loop version
var i = 0;
while (i < friends.length) {
    friend = friends[i];
    console.log(friend);
    i++;
}
```
How can we apply this pattern to our `circles` array?

Within the `update` function, below **TODO 8**, follow the pattern above and create a loop that will iterate over the `circles` array and assign `circle` to the element at the current index `i`. 

#### TODO 9 : Move all our circles and keep them all in bounds

Awesome job! Now that we have our loop in place and we are iterating over our `circles` Array, let's use the `circle` that we pull out on each loop to do some cool stuff!

1. Within the loop that you just created, call the `physikz.updatePosition(circle)` function.
2. Then, call the `checkCircleBounds(circle)` function.
3. Delete your calls to those functions from **TODO 4** and **TODO 6**
4. Sit back and relax

Congrats!
